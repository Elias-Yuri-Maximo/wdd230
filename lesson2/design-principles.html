                    The principle ilustrated by google's search page is white space
                    It's design focuses on what it is supposed to do, and does it 
                    very effictively, the main thing it is there to do is to dp searches 
                    and it does not distracts the user with adds and other things, instead
                    it opts for a lot of white space, a search bar and their logo. 
                    The success is often atributed to this feature of their design. 
                    (Comparing its design to Yahoo`s is an easy way to see the strength 
                    of thei design choice.)

                    The principle ilustrated by the church`s website is visual hierarchy.
                    The website shows through design what the most important part of the
                    page is. It positions the most important article on top, making it the
                    first thing the user sees and also making of a bigger size than the others
                    which naturally draws more attention. (One interesting only visible on the 
                    desktop version is that it uses the golden ratio, and currently Jesus Christ`s 
                    face is right in the center.
